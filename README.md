OpenLIT is an **OpenTelemetry-native** GenAI and LLM Application Observability tool. It's designed to make the integration process of observability into GenAI projects as easy as pie ‚Äì literally, with just **a single line of code**. Whether you're working with popular LLM Libraries such as OpenAI and HuggingFace or leveraging vector databases like ChromaDB, OpenLIT ensures your applications are monitored seamlessly, providing critical insights to improve performance and reliability.

This project proudly follows the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) of the OpenTelemetry community, consistently updating to align with the latest standards in observability.

## What is LIT?

LIT stands for Learning Interpretability Tool. It refers to a visual, interactive model-understanding and data visualization tool ad a term introduced by [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#learning-interpretability-tool-lit).

## ‚ö° Features

- **OpenTelemetry-native**: Native support ensures that integrating OpenLIT into your projects feels more like a natural extension rather than an additional layer of complexity.
- **Granular Usage Insights of your LLM Applications**: Assess your LLM's performance and costs with fine-grained control, breaking down metrics by environment (such as staging or production) or application, to optimize for efficiency and scalability.
- **Vendor-Neutral SDKs**: In the spirit of OpenTelemetry, OpenLIT's SDKs are agnostic of the backend vendors. This means you can confidently use OpenLIT with various telemetry backends, like Grafana Tempo, without worrying about compatibility issues.
